# React Native Starter

A minimal React Native starter template designed to help you get comfortable using an AI agent to build mobile apps. Make changes, see them live, and learn by doing.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools. From there you can run the app on:

- Your physical device using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

## Project Structure

```
app/
  (tabs)/
    _layout.tsx    # Tab navigation setup
    index.tsx      # Home screen
    profile.tsx    # Profile screen
lib/
  theme.ts         # Colors, typography, spacing
assets/
  images/          # App images
```

## Using with an AI Agent

This template is intentionally simple. Ask your AI agent to:

- Add new screens or components
- Change colors or styling in `lib/theme.ts`
- Add new tabs to the navigation
- Integrate APIs or add features

Watch your changes appear live as you iterate. This is a playground—experiment freely.
